# Let's Learn Databases!

*All the joy of a database environment without the pain of setup and configuration.*

This repository contains docker configurations and base scripts necessary to provide a complete database management system with sample data and web-based tooling.

Use this software to accompany the Applied Database Management textbook, the Introduction to Database Management Systems course, or to just explore databases on your own! 

## What's included

1. **Microsoft Azure SQL Edge** database management system.
2. **Database Provisioner** Application for creating sample databases and populating data.
3. **SQL Pad** a web-based query tool.
4. **Adminer** a web-based database admin tool.

## Hardware Requirements

1. A computer with one of these Operating Systems:

   - Mac OSX  
   - Windows 10  
 [https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13443/windows-which-version-am-i-running)
   - Any Linux (Ubunutu, Fedora, etc. ) or  
   - Chrome OS w/Linux support enabled   
 [https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/9145439?hl=en) 
2. At least 8GB RAM.
3. At least 8 GB free disk space. 

## Software Requirements

1. Docker is used to manage the containers. On Windows and Mac, download Docker Desktop 3.5 or higher. Installation instructions are here:   
[https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
  You must allocate at least 1CPU and 4GB of RAM to docker.  
  Mac: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources)  
  Windows: [https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/#resources)  
  Linux/ChromeOS: No Configuration Necessary, but you will need to install docker-compose separately.
2. Azure Data Studio. This is the client tool used to connect to the Microsoft SQL Server and compliments the web equivalents of SQL Pad and Adminer.

## Running the containers

NOTE: If you are using a Mac with the M1 chip, you must use the `docker-compose-m1.yaml` file. e.g. `docker-compose -f docker-compose-m1.yaml ps` 

1. Open a terminal window inside the `learn-databases` folder. This is where you cloned or unzipped the code repository.
2. Type : `docker-compose up -d` to start everything. This might take some time as images are downloaded and/or built.
3. Type : `docker-compose ps` to see the `mssql`,  `webapp`, `sqlpad`, `adminer` containers in a running **Up** state.

## Creating the Sample Databases

The **Database Provisioner** webapp can be used to create the sample databases. It will also display the database login information. 

1. To launch the **Database Provisioner* application, open a web browser and connect to:  
 [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
 Database Connection information appears in the upper right, and a list of databases you can provision appears in the application window.  
   - Click the icon in the **Info** section to learn about each  database.
   - Click the **Create** button to generate the database schema and initial data for a database. 
   - If the database is updatable, Click the **Update** button to bring the data current.
   - You can click **Drop** at any time to remove the database, or **Recreate** to place the database back in its initial state. 

**Note:** These  commands can take time depending on the size or complexity of the database. Please be patient!

## Connecting with Azure Data Studio

1. Open `Azure Data Studio`
2. Under `Servers` select `Add New Connection`
3. Fill in the connection information based on the information displayed in the Database Provisioner application.
4. Here's a quick tutorial you can follow to learn Azure Data Studio.   
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/azure-data-studio/quickstart-sql-server)

## Connecting with SQL Pad

[SQL Pad](https://rickbergfalk.github.io/sqlpad/#/) is a browser-based query tool. You can connect to the SQL Server database and execute any query in the SQL language.

1. Open a web browser and connect to:   
[http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001) to launch the SQL Pad web application.
2. Click on **Connections**
3. Click **Add Connection**
4. Enter a connection name and choose `SQL Server` for the driver. Enter the connection information from the Database Provisioner application. 

## Connecting with Adminer

[Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) is a browser-based database admin tool. You can create database objects and edit data without using the SQL language. 

1. Open a web browser and connect to:  
[http://localhost:5002](http://localhost:5002) to launch the Adminer web application.
2. From the login screen, choose `MS SQL` as the system and then enter the connection information from the Database Provisioner application.

## Stopping the containers

When you are finished using the database, you might want to stop the docker containers to save the CPU and Memory resources on your host computer. The containers will remain up, even between reboots, until you tell docker to stop them.

To stop all containers, type: `docker-compose down`.

If you want to just stop one of the containers  you can use the `stop` option. For example to stop the Adminer service container, type:  
`docker-compose stop adminer`

To start an individual service, you can use the `start` option:  
`docker-compose start sqlpad`  

Or to start all containers, you can use:  
`docker-compose up -d`
